# Casino Gulag Protocol

1. Bunks can be purchased, but can never be sold (they cannot be transferred after purchase). They can only be held or burned.
2. Bunks are sold at a fixed price of 0.1 BNB (on BSC) or 0.1ETH (on Ethereum).
3. 1, 10, 100, 1000, or 10000 bunks can be purchased in a single transaction.
4. To purchase bunks, you must send the appropriate number of coins to the contract. 94% of these coins are distributed directly to all bunk holders, and 6% goes into the *misery pot*. 
5. Of the 94%, if the total number of coins cannot be divided by the total number of existing bunks, the remainder goes into the misery pot.
6. Every x blocks (approximately 30 days), there is one *day of misery*: whoever *burns* the most bunks during this one day period gets *all* the coins currently in the misery pot. 
7. Bunks must have been purchased *before* the day of misery begins.
